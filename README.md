## Learning Next JS
In this project I was able to learn about the awesome framework of Nextjs.

### Key Features Learned of Nextjs

- Server-side Rendering: Preparing the content of the page on the server instead of the client. Great for SEO and initial load using JSX. Blending client and server side. Fetch data on the server and render finished pages.

- File-based Routing. Define pages and routes with files and folders instead. Less code, less work, highly understandable.

- Fullstack Capablities: Easily add backend server side code to your Next/React apps. Storing, getting and authentication data. can be added to your React project.

### Special Hooks Learned
import { useRouter } from 'next/router; (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/router)

import { Fragment } from 'react'; (https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html)

import Link from 'next/link'; (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link)


### File-based system notes:
- Nested Files: )(https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)
- Dynamic Pathing: (https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes)
    *ie: [newsId].js

### Usage
